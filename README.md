This is a review of Reinfoircement Learning.

It has three parts, 1) fundation of RL, 2) RL based on value function, 3) RL based on direct policy search.

# Fundation of RL

- ## Markov Decision Process | Day 1

  What is MDP
  MDP is a transition matrix with actions and rewards.
  MDP is used to simulate a world in the form of a grid by dividing it into states, actions, rewards, and transition models.
 

  Circle is state.
  {Facebook, Quit, Study, Pub, Sleep} are actions.
  R is reward.

  MDP and RL
  a reinforcement learning task composed of states, actions, rewards that follows Markov property would be considered a MDP.
