This is a review of Reinfoircement Learning.

It has three parts, 1) fundation of RL, 2) RL based on value function, 3) RL based on direct policy search.

# Fundation of RL

- ## Markov Decision Process | Day 1

  ### What is MDP
  MDP is a transition matrix with actions and rewards.<br>
  MDP is used to simulate a world in the form of a grid by dividing it into states, actions, rewards, and transition models.

  Circle is state.<br>
  {Facebook, Quit, Study, Pub, Sleep} are actions.<br>
  R is reward.
  
  MDP is defined as the following:
  
  - **States**: S
  - **Actions**:A(s), A
  - **Transition model**: T(s,a,s') ~ P(s'|s,a)
  - **Rewards**: R(s), R(s,a), R(s,a,s')
  - **Policy**: Ï€
  
  ### MDP and RL
  A reinforcement learning task composed of states, actions, rewards that follows Markov property would be considered a MDP.
